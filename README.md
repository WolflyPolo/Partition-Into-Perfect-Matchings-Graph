# Partition-Into-Perfect-Matchings-Graph
An approach about the NP-Hard problem: Partition Into Perfect Matchings, in which I worked in the class of Complexity and Algorithms, in Universidad del Norte, which I wanted to share with the world. My basic approach has a particular trouble, which I state in the readme.md file. 

# Description of the Problem: 
In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, a matching or independent edge set in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. 
A perfect matching (a.k.a. 1-factor) is a matching which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one edge of the matching.

## Usage

Click within the black border of the rectangle to create a node. Click two nodes (it gets yellow when clicked) to create an edge between the two.
Create a graph and then go press the button "Perfect Matching" to see if the Perfect Matching exist.

### Some particular trouble

I couldn't, in the time I was making the task, create a good determinant method to get the Tutte Matrix, so my program works only for complete graphs. A complete graph is a graph in which every edge is adjacent to every other edge of the graph.

## Further notes

* I will try whenever I can to improve this code for the future.
* A better determinant method has to be found to quit out the complete graph restriction.
